# üß† Celebrity Face Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting **celebrity faces** using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)** ‚Äî a state-of-the-art object detection model.  
It covers both **model training** and **testing** on single and collage images, with optional face recognition using **DeepFace**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project is divided into two main notebooks:

### üß© 1. `main_code.ipynb`
This notebook handles **training, testing, validating and demo** the YOLOv8 model.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
- Installed required dependencies and mounted Google Drive.
- Loaded and prepared the **celebrity face dataset**.
- Configured YOLOv8 model parameters using a custom YAML file.
- Trained the YOLOv8 model for **face detection**.
- Evaluated performance on validation/test data.
- Visualized predictions on sample images.
- Saved trained model weights for future use.
- Detected and recognized faces in:
  - Individual test images.
  - **collage images** (to test detection on multiple faces).
- Integrated **DeepFace** for celebrity recognition.
- Applied image enhancements (brightness, rotation, contrast) for improved results.
- Displayed detection outputs with bounding boxes and labels.
- Implemented a **Gradio interface** for easy testing.

‚úÖ **Outcome:** A trained YOLOv8 model capable of detecting celebrity faces with high accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è YOLOv8 Architecture ‚Äî How It Works

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a real-time object detection algorithm that views detection as a single regression problem ‚Äî directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from an image in one pass.

### üß© Architecture Components
1. **Input Layer:** Resizes and normalizes images.  
2. **Backbone (CSPDarknet):** Extracts deep image features.  
3. **Neck (PANet):** Merges multi-scale feature maps for better context.  
4. **Head:** Predicts bounding boxes, objectness scores, and class probabilities.  
5. **Output:** Detects faces with bounding boxes and confidence levels.

### üöÄ What Makes YOLOv8 Better
- **Anchor-free detection** for faster training and inference.  
- **Improved backbone** and **dynamic shape input support**.  
- Handles **detection, segmentation, classification, and pose estimation**.  
- Optimized for **real-time applications**.
